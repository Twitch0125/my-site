## Education

### Learn UI Design ([learnui.design](https://learnui.design))
<Subheading style="margin-top: -0.75rem"> Enrolled 2022 </Subheading>

A Course in UI (and tangentially, UX) Design. Students have gone on to companies like Apple, Meta, Stripe, Netflix, and more.

I enrolled because while I was at Lingotek I noticed we were severely lacking in the design of our apps. So I kinda just jumped right in so I could improve it myself.

### MTech - Web Programming ([mtec.edu](https://mtec.edu))
