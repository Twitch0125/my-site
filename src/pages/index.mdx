## Experience

### Software Engineer (Straker Lingotek)
<Subheading style="margin-top: -0.75rem">Oct 2019 - Current</Subheading>

- 3 years experience as a UI focused software engineer at Lingotek.
- Rewrote and Redesigned 3 angularjs apps as Vue 2 apps.
  - One was a chrome extension. Moved from Manifest v2 to Manifest v3 as part of the rewrite
- Worked on a few Nodejs microservices (our authentication and authorization services).
- Started a UX effort by helping to define a style guide, and come up with a solution to implement the style guide in our existing apps.
- Worked with software architect to convert hundreds of JSP templates to Vue components to decouple our monolith.

## Education

### Learn UI Design ([learnui.design](https://learnui.design))

A Course in UI (and tangentially, UX) Design. Students have gone on to companies like Apple, Meta, Stripe, Netflix, and more.

I enrolled because while I was at Lingotek I noticed we were severely lacking in the design of our apps. So I kinda just jumped right in so I could improve it myself.

### MTech - Web Programming ([mtec.edu](https://mtec.edu))

Enrolled to learn Web Development. I already knew the basics of programming and just wanted to be able to learn the tools of the trade. It was about 8 months long and did several projects, some were solo and some were group projects.

- Chat Application - Ionic/Angular, Giphy API, Firebase
- Mock E-commerce store - React, MUI, random product api
- User Manager - Express, MongoDB, Pug,
- Chat Room - Express, SocketIO, JS
