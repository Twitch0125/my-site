# Favorite Anythings

These are all things that I like, and might not actually be a "favorite"... I'm pretty indecisive. I'll add on to here over time.

or maybe I won't

### Entertainment
I'm really critical of a lot of movies and entertainment media... But I still like some!
#### Movies
- Forrest Gump
- Lord of The Rings Trilogy
- Joker
- Star Wars (all except 7-9. Those were terrible)
#### TV Shows
- The Simpsons
- Breaking Bad
- Better Call Saul
- 

#### Companies/Brands
[37Signals](https://37signals.com/) -
37Signals/Basecamp has been kind of a rebel in the software world lately. They introduced Hotwire, which was a way for you to write highly interactive applications without having to write any javascript. Instead you're using server side rendered templates, and streaming the html to the client. That just flies in the face of today's development, where you a lot of times your app is completely powered by javascript.

I also strongly agree with some of their "signals" they've listed on their site
