## Education

### Learn UI Design ([learnui.design](https://learnui.design))

A Course in UI (and tangentially, UX) Design. Students have gone on to companies like Apple, Meta, Stripe, Netflix, and more.

I enrolled because while I was at Lingotek I noticed we were severely lacking in the design of our apps. So I kinda just jumped right in so I could improve it myself.

### MTech - Web Programming ([mtec.edu](https://mtec.edu))

Enrolled to learn Web Development. I already knew the basics of programming and just wanted to be able to learn the tools of the trade. It was about 8 months long and did several projects, some were solo and some were group projects.
